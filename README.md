# Introduction example to Artificial Neural Networks

This project show a simple example on training a multi-layer perceptron neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST Handwritten Digits database.

It uses PyTorch and some commom Python data science modules. See `requirements.txt`.

Which a 768-100-10 network and training for 3 epochs it's easy to achieve 97% of correct classification on the testing database, considering the highest output as the digit index.

## The MNIST Database

To run the tests you'll need the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The MNIST database is a database of handwritten digits and is widely used for testing the results of machine learning systems. Based on the NIST original datasets, the database contains 60.000 training examples, and 10.000 testing samples. You can find the database in the [MNIST repository of the Common Visual Data Foundation](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist?tab=readme-ov-file).
